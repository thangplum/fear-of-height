Modular Skyscraper Pack HD

Introduction
Now your city scenes can reach to the sky with the most comprehensive highrise building pack available. This pack includes many extras, but the skyscrapers are the stars of the show. These ultra-realistic buildings are fully navigable, from the floor to the roof, allowing for unprecedented access and gameplay possibilities. Ranging from 20-30 stories each, these highrises are modular in design which means you can quickly create variations in height with stunning results. Hundreds of stories per building are possible.

Installation
Simply doubleclick the .unitypackage to install in your project or do so directly through the Unity Asset Store.

Example Scenes, Scripts, Controls
The example scenes offered can be accessed through a main menu scene. There is an FPS example with a simpler character controller added to explore from the ground up, as well as two scene variations set up with a free camera flythru. Four simple scripts are included to facilitate the example scenes.

FPS controls: 

W,A,S,D for movement
Spacebar: Jump
Escape: return to main menu

Flythru controls:
LMB: Forward/Back
RMB: Rotate 
LMB+RMB: Up/Down, Side to Side
Escape: return to main menu

LODs
Each building comes in a high quality version which has all the detail, such as “BagSS01base_high.fbx”. Additionally, there are lower detail versions of each building included (in the LOD folder). The number at the end of each filename indicates a suggested pixel height for that LOD, for example "BagSS01base_500.fbx". The higher numbered files have more detail, with the lowest detail files having zero (0) at the end of the filename.

Step Height
The slope limit and step offset have been tweaked in the example scene to make the stairs and ramps more navigable. This will vary depending on character assets used.

Whats Included:

11 unique, modular, multi-story, fully navigable highrise buildings (with balconies, stairways and roof access!). Each building comes in 3 sections that are separate shapes (33 total): base, mid and top. These pieces seam up perfectly with offsets calculated to make it easy on developers. Simply place each piece at the same world co-ordinates and the building is complete. You can also “raise the roof” and add more mid sections to achieve even higher results. 
 
Six Levels of Detail (LODs) for each building section provided as separate meshes (over 55 additional  building meshes, in 165 sections!).
 
42 additional city prop shapes each with 4 LODs.

24 graffiti decals.
